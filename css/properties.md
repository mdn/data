At its core, CSS consists of [properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#index).

## Structure for long-hand properties
A long-hand property might look like this:

```json
"background-color": {
  "syntax": "<color>",
  "media": "visual",
  "inherited": false,
  "animationType": "color",
  "percentages": "no",
  "groups": [
    "CSS Background and Borders"
  ],
  "initial": "transparent",
  "appliesto": "allElements",
  "computed": "computedColor",
  "order": "uniqueOrder",
  "alsoAppliesTo": [
    "::first-letter",
    "::first-line",
    "::placeholder"
  ],
  "status": "standard"
},
```


## Structure for short-hand properties
A short-hand property might look like this:

```json
"background": {
  "syntax": "[ <bg-layer> , ]* <final-bg-layer>",
  "media": "visual",
  "inherited": false,
  "animationType": [
    "background-color",
    "background-image",
    "background-clip",
    "background-position",
    "background-size",
    "background-repeat",
    "background-attachment"
  ],
  "percentages": [
    "background-position",
    "background-size"
  ],
  "groups": [
    "CSS Background and Borders"
  ],
  "initial": [
    "background-image",
    "background-position",
    "background-size",
    "background-repeat",
    "background-origin",
    "background-clip",
    "background-attachment",
    "background-color"
  ],
  "appliesto": "allElements",
  "computed": [
    "background-image",
    "background-position",
    "background-size",
    "background-repeat",
    "background-origin",
    "background-clip",
    "background-attachment",
    "background-color"
  ],
  "order": "orderOfAppearance",
  "alsoAppliesTo": [
    "::first-letter",
    "::first-line",
    "::placeholder"
  ],
  "status": "standard"
},
```

## Properties of a `Property` object

There are 11 required properties in this object:
* `syntax` (string): This is the formal syntax of the property and is usually found in the specification. It might contain references to [syntax data](https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/master/css/syntaxes.md).
For more information see also
[Value definition syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Value_definition_syntax)
on MDN and the [CSS Values and Units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#value-defs) specification.
* `media` (string): The media groups this property applies to, e.g. "all, visual" (multiple values are comma-separated).
* `inherited` (boolean): Whether or not the property is inherited. See [inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inheritance) for details.
* `animationType` (enum or array of property names):
  * If it is an enum (appropriate for long-hand properties), this is the animation type of the property.
  * If it is an array (appropriate for short-hand properties), these are the properties the animation type is taken from.
* `percentages` (enum or array of property names):
  * If it is an enum (appropriate for long-hand properties), this defines what the percentage actually refers to when a percentage is set as a value on the property ("no" means that the property can't accept a percentage as a value).
  * If it is an array (appropriate for short-hand properties), these are the long-hand properties making up part of the short-hand value that percentages can be set as values for.
* `groups` (array of unique strings with at least 1 entry): CSS is organized in modules like "CSS Fonts" or "CSS Animations". MDN organizes features in these groups as well â€” `groups` should contain the name of the module(s) the property is defined in.
* `initial` (string or array of property names):
  * If it is a string (appropriate for long-hand properties), this is the initial value of the property.
  * If it is an array (appropriate for short-hand properties), these are the properties the initial value is taken from.
* `appliesto` (enum): To which elements the property can be applied to. See the schema for [a list of enums](https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/master/css/properties.schema.json#L161)
* `computed` (enum or array of property names):
  * If it is an enum (appropriate for long-hand properties), this is the computed value of the property. See the schema for [a list of enums](https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/master/css/properties.schema.json#L91).
  * If it is an array (appropriate for short-hand properties), these are the properties the value is computed from.
* `order` (enum): The [canonical order](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Canonical_order) for the property. See the schema for [a list of enums](https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/master/css/properties.schema.json#L261).
* `status` (enum): This is either `standard`, `nonstandard`, or `experimental` depending on the standardization status of the feature.

There are 3 more properties that are optional:
* `mdn_url` (string): a URL linking to the property's page on MDN. This URL must omit the localization part of the URL (such as `en-US/`).
* `stacking` (boolean): Whether or not the property creates a stacking context. See [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context) for details.
* `alsoAppliesTo` (enum): To which elements the property also applies to. See the schema for [a list of enums](https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/master/css/properties.schema.json#L253).
