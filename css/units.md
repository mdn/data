# Units

Units are CSS units like `em` or `px`. Most of them are defined in the
[CSS Values and Units specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/).

## Structure for units

A unit object looks like this:

```json
"ch": {
  "groups": [
    "CSS Units",
    "CSS Lengths"
  ],
  "status": "standard"
}
```

The 2 properties are both required.
* `groups` (array of strings): CSS is organized in modules like "CSS Units" or "CSS Lengths". MDN organizes features in these groups as well â€” `groups` should contain the name of the module(s) the unit is defined in.
* `status` (enum string): This is either `standard`, `nonstandard`, `experimental` or `obsolete` depending on the standardization status of the feature.
